# What is trading ?

Trading means “exchanging one item for another”. In the financial markets, it’s buying shares, futures, options, swaps,
bonds, etc..., or like in our case, an amount of cryptocurrency.

The idea here is to buy cryptocurrencies at a specific price and sell it at a higher price to make profits (even if you
can still make profits if the price goes down).

To make it simple, the value of an asset changes due to supply and demand: if many people want one bitcoin, the price
will go up. If a lot of people want to sell one bitcoin, the price will go down.

Nowadays, thanks to exchanges

(with Cassandre, for example) trading for you.
