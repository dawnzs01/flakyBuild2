As the sponsor of Zingg, Zingg Labs would like to ensure the long-term viability of Zingg and its community. For all code contributions to Zingg, we ask that contributors complete and sign a Contributor License Agreement. The Contributor License Agreement helps ensure everyone can enjoy Zingg with confidence that Zingg is here to stay.

Specifically, our Contributor License Agreement (CLA) grants the contributor and Zingg Labs joint copyright interest in contributed code. Further, it provides assurance from the contributor that contributions are original work that does not violate any third-party license agreement. The agreement between contributors and the Zingg project is explicit. This ensures that Zingg users can be confident in the legal status of the source code and their right to use it.
