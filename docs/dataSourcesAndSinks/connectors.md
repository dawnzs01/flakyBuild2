# Data Sources and Sinks

Zingg connects, reads, and writes to most on-premise and cloud data sources.

Zingg can read and write to Snowflake, Cassandra, S3, Azure, Elastic, Exasol, major RDBMS, and any Spark-supported data sources. Zingg also works with all major file formats like Parquet, Avro, JSON, XLSX, CSV, TSV, etc. This is done through the Zingg [pipe](pipes.md) abstraction.\
