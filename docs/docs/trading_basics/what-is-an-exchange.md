# What is an exchange ?

[Cryptocurrency exchanges](https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/)
like [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/activity/referral/offers/claim?ref=CPA_00002V0XR4)
, [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/straumat) ou [Kucoin](https://www.kucoin.com/ucenter/signup?rcode=2HMJtt1)
are online platforms where you can exchange an asset for another one based on the market value.

To make it simple, after creating an account, the exchange will allow you to buy an amount of a cryptocurrency in
exchange for your euros, dollars or other cryptocurrency (they usually take a fee for that). Be careful; in reality, you
don’t really “own” the cryptocurrency you will buy there: if you don’t own the private key, you have a “promise” that an
exchange owes you some assets.

Most exchanges also offer tools for trading cryptocurrency. For example, Coinbase
provides [this tool](https://pro.coinbase.com/).

More interesting in our case, most exchanges offer API for trading like
the [coinbase API](https://developers.coinbase.com/). Instead of spending hours trading in front of your computer, you
can write a program that trades for you. Cassandre is here to help you to do that.

One last point, some exchanges offer a sandbox that allows you to trade on the “simulated platform” with fake assets
like [Kucoin sandbox](https://sandbox.kucoin.com/).
