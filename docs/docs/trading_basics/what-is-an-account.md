# What is an account ?

Usually, on the exchange, you can have several accounts with different usages (Classical, trading, margin trading,
future...), and then you have a balance for each currency.

A balance is not merely the amount you have; it could be more complicated and can have the following values :

| Field | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| currency | Currency |
| total | Returns the total amount of the currency in this balance |
| available | Returns the amount of the currency in this balance that is available to trade |
| frozen | Returns the frozen amount of the currency in this balance that is locked in a trading |
| loaned | Returns the loaned amount of the total currency in this balance that will be returned |
| borrowed | Returns the borrowed amount of the available currency in this balance that must be repaid |
| withdrawing | Returns the amount of the currency in this balance that is locked in withdrawal |
| depositing | Returns the amount of the currency in this balance that is locked in deposit |
