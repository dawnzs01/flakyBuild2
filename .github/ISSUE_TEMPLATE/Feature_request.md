<!--

Before you submit a new issue please make sure it is in scope of this project:
- bugs in bttv-android
- features that exist in BTTV
- features that enhance quality of life (e.g. improving integration with existing Twitch behavior)

Not in scope:
- bugs not caused by the mod
- features that are unrelated to BTTV (e.g. a new theme)

This way the mod does not become bloated and is thus more stable and maintainable.

Also please check opened and closed issues on Github first, maybe somebody else has already opened a similar issue: https://github.com/bttv-android/bttv/issues?q=is%3Aissue

Thank you!
