    You need to be standing for this (i-pose). There is a 3 seconds delay (configurable) before it actually happens.
    This fully resets the position and rotation of all your trackers. It should fix most issues.
# Cares about multiline
onboarding-reset_tutorial-2 = Tap { $taps } times the highlighted tracker for triggering mounting reset.

    Mounting reset helps on how the trackers are actually put on you, so if you accidentally moved them and changed how they are oriented by a big amount, this will help.

    You need to be on a pose like you are skiing like it's shown on the Automatic Mounting wizard and you have a 3 second delay (configurable) before it gets triggered.
