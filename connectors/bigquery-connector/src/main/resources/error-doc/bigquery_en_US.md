***First***: check whether the 'existing data processing' strategy of the target table maintains the original structure of the target table;

***Second***: Check the generated table model;

***Third***: Check whether the table exists in BigQuery and check the table structure;

***Fourth***: check whether the table model generated by the task is consistent with the table structure of the table with the same name that exists in BigQuery, including fields and field types;

***Fifth***: In case of inconsistency, in order to avoid the problems caused by the inconsistency between the newly generated model and the target end table with the same name, it is recommended to change the 'processed data' strategy to 'clear the target end table structure and data'.
