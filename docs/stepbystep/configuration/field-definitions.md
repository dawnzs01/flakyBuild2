# Field Definitions

#### fieldDefinition

This is a JSON array representing the fields from the source data to be used for matching, and the kind of matching they need.

Each field denotes a column from the input. Fields have the following JSON attributes:

**fieldName**

The name of the field from the input data schema

**fields**

To be defined later. For now, please keep this as the fieldName

**dataType**

Type of the column - string, integer, double, etc.

**matchType**

&#x20;The way to match the given field. Multiple match types, separated by commas, can also be used. Here are the different types supported.&#x20;
