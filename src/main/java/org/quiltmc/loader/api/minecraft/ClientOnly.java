/** Applied to declare that the annotated element is present only in the client environment.
 * <p>
 * When applied to mod code this will result in quilt-loader removing that element when running on the dedicated server.
 * <p>
 * When the annotated element is removed, bytecode associated with the element will not be removed. For example, if a
 * field is removed, its initializer code will not, and will cause an error on execution.
 * <p>
 * If an overriding method has this annotation and its overridden method doesn't, unexpected behavior may happen. If an
 * overridden method has this annotation while the overriding method doesn't, it is safe, but the method can be used
 * from the overridden class only in the specified environment.
 * <p>
 * When applied to an implemented interface (via {@link ElementType#TYPE_USE}) it will be removed on the dedicated server.
 * Overridden interface methods need to be annotated separately in order to be removed.
