Megalodon is a modified version of the <a href="https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon-android">official Mastodon Android app</a> adding important features that are missing in the official app, such as the federated timeline, unlisted posting and an image description viewer.

<b>Key features</b>

- <b>Unlisted posting</b>: Post publicly without having your post show up in trends, hashtags or public timelines.
- <b>Federated timeline</b>: See all public posts from people on all other Fediverse neighborhoods your home instance is connected to.
- <b>Custom timelines</b>: Pin any list or hashtag to your Megalodon’s home tab to simply swipe between your favorite topics and people!
- <b>Drafts and scheduled posts</b>: Allows for preparing a post and scheduling it to send it automatically at a specific time.
- <b>Pinning posts</b>: Pin your most important posts to your profile and see what others have pinned using the “Pinned“ tab.
- <b>Follow hashtags</b>: See new posts from specific hashtags directly in your home timeline by following them.
- <b>Answering follow requests</b>: Accept or decline follow requests from your notifications or the dedicated Follow requests list.
- <b>Delete and re-draft</b>: The much-loved feature that made editing possible without an actual editing function.
- <b>Language selector</b>: Painlessly select the language for every post you make so filters and translation are working correctly.
- <b>Translation</b>: Easily translate posts right inside Megalodon! Only works if the feature is also available on your Mastodon Web.
- <b>Post visibility indicator</b>: When opening or replying to a post, a handy icon indicating the post’s visibility will be displayed.
- <b>Color themes</b>: Should you not like the default Pink color them (the shark is silently judging you), Moshidon’s color themes got you covered.
