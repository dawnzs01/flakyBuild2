A [survey of 510 business leaders by Dun & Bradstreet](https://www.forbes.com/sites/joemckendrick/2019/06/26/running-a-business-on-data-is-still-an-elusive-goal/?sh=2ae347d536d3) revealed that

- Almost 20% executives offered too much credit to a customer and 15% failed to sign a new customer due to lack of information about them
- Nearly half said that their internal data is too siloed to make any sense out of them
- 26% stated that they doubt the accuracy of their Data
