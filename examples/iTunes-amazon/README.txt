The dataset "iTunes-Amazon" has been taken from https://github.com/anhaidgroup/deepmatcher/blob/master/Datasets.md
and has been referred to in the paper https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~anhai/papers1/deepmatcher-sigmod18.pdf.
The "Price" value is denoted in dollars (e.g. $ 15.05). For modelling, the '$' sign has been removed to take its value as double.
