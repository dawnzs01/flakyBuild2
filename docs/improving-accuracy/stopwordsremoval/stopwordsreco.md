# Stop Words

Zingg may help users by recommending stop words by extracting high-frequency words from the user data. The same can be generated using the [generateDocs](../../generatingDocumentation.md) command. the stop word recommendation files are written in folder zinggDir/modelId/stopWords. These files may be used after modification in [configuration](./) to build a model.
