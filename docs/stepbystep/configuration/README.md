description: JSON configuration file required to work with Zingg

# Configuration

Zingg comes with a command-line script that invokes spark-submit. This script needs a JSON configuration file to define the input data and match types, location of training data, models, and output.

Sample configuration files are defined at [examples/febrl](https://github.com/zinggAI/zingg/tree/main/examples/febrl) and [examples/febrl120k](https://github.com/zinggAI/zingg/tree/main/examples/febrl120k).

The following sections describe the different JSON attributes of the configuration to get Zingg to work with your data.
