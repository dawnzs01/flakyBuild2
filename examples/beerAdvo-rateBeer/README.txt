The dataset "BeerAdvo-RateBeer" has been taken from https://github.com/anhaidgroup/deepmatcher/blob/master/Datasets.md
and has been referred to in the paper https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~anhai/papers1/deepmatcher-sigmod18.pdf.
The "ABV" value is denoted in percentage (e.g. 5.5 %). For modelling, the '%' sign has been removed to take its value as double.
