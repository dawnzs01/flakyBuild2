## Thank you for your interest in contributing to Instancio!

Contribution can take many forms, all of which would be greatly appreciated.

### :heart: Spread the word

As this is a relatively new project, it is not widely known.
If you find Instancio useful, please help spread the word.
Any mention on social media, blogs, articles, etc. would help make it a little more known.

### :beetle: Bug reports

If you come across a bug or an error in documentation, please raise an issue.
For bugs, a minimal reproducible sample would be very helpful for troubleshooting.

### :question: Questions and feedback

Feedback is also very welcome, whether positive or negative.
If you have a question or feedback, please create a post in the [Discussions](https://github.com/instancio/instancio/discussions).
No post will go unanswered. :)

### :computer: Contributing code

Pull requests for bug fixes would be greatly appreciated! If you'd like to add a new feature,
consider creating an issue first to discuss the details. 

To build the project, the following pages should get you started:

- https://www.instancio.org/getting-started/
- https://www.instancio.org/building/

When writing code, consider the following:

- Import the [format config](https://github.com/instancio/instancio/blob/main/ide/instancio-formatter.xml) for IntelliJ.
  (No config file available for Eclipse yet).
- Follow existing naming conventions.
- Update Javadocs when making changes to the public API. Include examples, if applicable. Do not include `@author` tags.
  Once your changes are merged, your username will be listed on the Contributors page on GitHub.
- Goes without saying: include tests :)
- Squash all your commits into one and rebase your changes on top of main. Do not merge main into your feature branch.
- Create a descriptive commit message.
