# What is a cryptocurrency ?

A cryptocurrency is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses strong cryptography to secure
financial transactions, control the creation of additional units, and verify assets' transfer.

Cryptocurrencies use decentralized control as opposed to centralized digital currency and central banking systems.

Bitcoin is the first decentralized cryptocurrency. Since the release of bitcoin, over 6,000 other cryptocurrencies have
been created.
